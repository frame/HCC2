8 MB free hard drive space (additional 5 MB for the Live Update).

These are bundled with the Installer.

No Horizons game-client installation required, but supported. Please do NOT install HCC into the Horizons game folder.


For HCC v1 Users
----------------------------------
!! Do NOT install in the same folder where HCC v1 is located !!
Both releases can co-exist, however need different installation folders.

It's recommend to uninstall any older HCC releases before installing any version of the v.2+ branch: Uninstalling HCC v1 after installing v.2+ will lead to a broken Application.
You can solve this however by reinstalling the latest version.
